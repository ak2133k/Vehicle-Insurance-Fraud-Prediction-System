Vehicle Accident Insurance Fraud Prediction System

->An AI-powered insurance claim evaluation system that combines Machine Learning models with
real-world insurance policy rules to detect fraudulent vehicle accident insurance claims and make legally compliant decisions.

Project Overview

->Insurance fraud causes significant financial losses to insurance companies every year.
->This project builds a smart fraud detection system that evaluates vehicle insurance claims using:
* Supervised Machine Learning
* Business rule–based policy validation
* Legal & compliance logic
->The system determines whether a claim is Genuine or Fraudulent, and provides clear reasons for approval or rejection, similar to real insurance claim processing systems.

Key Objectives

*Detect fraudulent insurance claims
*Reduce false approvals using risk-based scoring
*Simulate real insurance company decision logic
*Provide transparent, explainable decisions for claims
